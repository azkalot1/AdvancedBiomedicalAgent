# AdvancedBiomedicalAgent Repository Rules

## Environment Setup
- **ALWAYS** activate the `biomedagent` conda environment before running any Python scripts or commands in this repository
- Use: `conda activate biomedagent` or `source activate biomedagent`
- All terminal commands that execute Python code must be run within this environment

## Database Configuration
- The project uses PostgreSQL for storing clinical trial and biomedical data
- Default database config is in `src/bioagent/data/ingest/config.py`
- Tables follow the AACT (Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov) schema

## Code Style
- Follow existing patterns for data ingestion and search functionality
- Use type hints consistently
- Group related data by headers to avoid duplication in output rendering
